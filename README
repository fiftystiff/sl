むかしにも投稿された冗談ソフトの sl の豪華版です。
アイデアは借り物ですが、プログラム自体は私のオリジナルです。
a,l,F オプションが有効です。機能は実行して確かめてください。
make すればできあがります。



I have no idea what characterset that was trying to use, and I 
have no idea what it says. So here is a new one.

This is sl. It makes a steam locomotive appear when you type ls wrong.
This is the source (from 1993) pulled from the developer's website.
I modified it a little bit to make it more vulgar and slow it down slightly.
Modification inspired by /u/hisham_hm on reddit.

From what I can tell from editing it, sl.h is templates for the trains
and sl.c uses ncurses to make them run.

You should be able to just run "make" and then copy the binary to /usr/local/bin 
or something. If you have trouble running make then make sure you have ncurses
installed. On a RHEL machine use
  # sudo yum install ncurses-devel ncurses
On a debian or ubuntu box
  $ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
Arch users, you guys are on your own, but it shouldn't be hard.

CHOO CHOO MOTHERFUCKER!
